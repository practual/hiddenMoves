HIDden Moves
===========

HIDden Moves (HM) is a Node.js module that provides an interface with [PS Move controllers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Move), when connected by Bluetooth to a device running HM.

HM depends on [node-hid](https://github.com/hanshuebner/node-hid) for the low-level communication with the devices.
